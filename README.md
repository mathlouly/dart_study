This repository has a model of improving my knowledge of dart through examples.

## 💻 Requirements

Before starting, you need to check that you already have the Dart SDK installed and that your version is the same as the examples.

- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

Version Dart SDK: `2.12.0 (stable)"`

## 👩‍💻 Usage

To use it you need to navigate to an example folder and use the command below.
```
dart <path>/file.dart
```
Note - Start the server first and then the client
